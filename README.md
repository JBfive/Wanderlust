Practice Building


Using fetch, async, and await, requesting information from the Foursquare API and APIXU to create a travel website.

If you are going to use this code you will need the following information:
Before you begin, you’ll need to register for developer accounts for both of the APIs above. They’re both free. For Foursquare, once you make an account, create a new app and fill out the form (you can put any link in the “App or Company URL” field).

The Foursquare API will then give you a client ID and a client secret. You’ll need to save both of those in main.js. APIXU will give you an API Key, which you’ll also need to save in main.js.
